# city-weather-forecast
an app that allows you to search for weather forecasts by city

Description

The attached project file(s) are for our sixth challenge as part of the UC Berkeley full stack coding bootcamp. The goal of the challenge was to create our own weather forecasting application. In my example, I used bulma to create the UX where users can search for the weather forecast of a city of their choice. Additionally, their search history is saved to the page using local storage, which allows them to click on past searches as a shortcut, of sorts. Some of the parameters we were we were instructed to abide by were to get the current forecast for the weather, a five-day forecast, and allow search results to be saved to local storage.

I really enjoyed this project and enjoyed getting to use the openweathermap API. It's clear that the API is well maintained and simple to use, giving you data in JSON objects that are easy to access. 

Installation
